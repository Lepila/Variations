    <h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Factory</em> </h1> 
<ul>
<li>
<h5> <ul>
<li> A factory.</li>
<li>Clouds of smoke above.</li>
<li>The people - simple,
	the life - hard, boring.</li>
<li>Life with the mask and greasepaint off
	is a savage dog snarling.</li>
</ul></h5>	
</li>
<li><em> You must tirelessly fight,
	must be tough and persist,
	to extract from the teeth
	of the angry,
		bristling beast
	a crust.</em>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <small>Slapping belts in the shed,
	screeching shafts overhead,
	and the air is so stale
	you can't easily
	deeply
	inhale.</small> 
	
	
</li>
<li><h5><ul>
	<li>Not far off the spring breeze
		rocks the fields, the sun calls...</li>
		<li>Leaning skyward
			the trees
	shade -
	the factory walls.</li>
</ul> 
	</h5>
	
</li>
<li><h5><ul>
	<li>
		How unwanted,
		forgotten
	and strange
	 are the fields!
	</li>
</ul></h5>
	
</li>
<li> <em>	They 
	have thrown in the dustbin
	the sky and its dreams.</em>

</li>
<li> <small>For to stray for a second
	or soften your heart,
	is to lose to no purpose
	your strong
		worker's 
			arm.</small>
	
</li>
<li>
	You must shout in the clatter
	and din of machines
	for your words
			to pass over.
	the spaces between.
</li>
<li> <ul>
	<li>I shouted for years -
		an eternity...</li>
		<li>I shouted for years -
			an eternity...</li>
			<li>I gathered the others too shouted in chorus -
				the factory,
					 the machinery
				and the man
					in the farthest
							darkest corner.</li>
</ul>
	
	
</li>
<li>
	This shout forged an alloy of steel
	and we armoured our life with its plate.
	Just try putting
			a spoke on the wheel -
	it's your own hand you'll break.
</li>
<li> <small>You, factory,
	still seek to blind us
	with smoke and soot
	layer on layer.
	In vain! For you teach us to struggle,
	we'll bring
	the sun
	down to us here.</small>
	
	
</li>
<li> <big>So many
	toil-blackened
			faces
under your tyranny smart,
but one heart within you tirelessly
beats with a thousand hearts.</big>
	
</li>
</ul>
