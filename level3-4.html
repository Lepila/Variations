		<div class="box">A factory. Clouds of smoke above. The people - simple, the life - hard, boring. Life with the mask and greasepaint off is a savage dog snarling.</div>
		<div class="box">You must tirelessly fight, must be tough and persist, to extract from the teeth of the angry, bristling beast a crust.</div>
		<div class="box">Slapping belts in the shed, screeching shafts overhead, and the air is so stale you can't easily deeply inhale.</div>
		<div class="box">Not far off the spring breeze rocks the fields, the sun calls... Leaning skyward the trees shade - the factory walls.</div>
		<div class="box">How unwanted, forgotten and strange are the fields!</div>
		<div class="box">They have thrown in the dustbin the sky and its dreams.</div>
		<div class="box">For to stray for a second or soften your heart, is to lose to no purpose your strong worker's arm.</div>
		<div class="box">You must shout in the clatter and din of machines for your words to pass over. the spaces between.</div>
		<div class="box">I shouted for years - an eternity... I gathered the others too shouted in chorus - the factory, the machinery and the man in the farthest darkest corner.</div>
		<div class="box">This shout forged an alloy of steel and we armoured our life with its plate. Just try putting a spoke on the wheel - it's your own hand you'll break.</div>
		<div class="box">You, factory, still seek to blind us with smoke and soot layer on layer. In vain! For you teach us to struggle, we'll bring the sundown to us here.</div>
		<div class="box">So many toil- blackened faces under your tyranny smart, but one heart within you tirelessly beats with a thousand hearts.</div>
