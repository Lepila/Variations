<p>A factory. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clouds of smoke above.
<br>The people - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; simple,
the life - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hard, boring.
Life with the mask and greasepaint off
<br>is a savage dog snarling. </p> 

<p>Y &nbsp;o &nbsp;u must tirelessly fight,
	<br>must be tough a &nbsp;n &nbsp;d persist,
to extract from the teeth
of the angry,
	bristling beast
	<br>a crust.</p> 

<p>Slapping belts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the shed,
	<br>screeching shafts &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; overhead,
	and the air is so &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stale
	you can't easily
	deeply
	<br>inhale.</p> 

<p> N &nbsp;o &nbsp;t f &nbsp;a &nbsp;r o &nbsp;f &nbsp;f the spring breeze
	<br>rocks the fields, the sun calls...
	Leaning skyward
			the trees
	shade - &nbsp;
	<br>the factory walls.</p>

<p> How unwanted,
	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;forgotten
and strange
<br>are the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fields!</p>

<p>They 
	<br>have thrown in the dustbin
	<br>the sky and its dreams.</p> 

<p>For to stray &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for a second
	<br>or soften &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your heart,
	is to lose &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to no purpose
	your strong
		worker's 
		<br>	arm.</p> 

<p>You must shout in the clatter
	<br>and din of machines
	for your words
			to pass over.
			<br>the spaces between.</p> 

<p>I shouted for years - &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	<br>an eternity...
	I gathered the others too shouted in chorus -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	the factory,
		 the machinery
	and the man
		in the farthest
		<br>	darkest corner.</p> 

<p> This shout forged an alloy of steel
	<br>and we armoured our life with its plate.
	Just try putting
			a spoke on the wheel - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
			<br>it's your own hand you'll break.</p>

<p> You, factory,
	<br>	still seek to blind us
	with smoke and soot
	layer on layer.
	In vain! For you teach us to struggle,
	we'll bring
	the sun
	<br>	down to us here.
	</p>
<p>So many
	<br>toil- &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blackened
			faces
under your tyranny &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;smart,
but one heart within you tirelessly
<br>beats with a thousand hearts.</p>
