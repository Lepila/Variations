	<p>A factory. Clouds of smoke above. The <br>p<br>e<br>o<br>p<br>l<br>e<br> -  simple, the life - hard, boring. Life with the mask and greasepaint off is a savage dog s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rling. </p>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to extract from the teeth <br>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;u&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s &nbsp; &nbsp;t.</p> 

	<p>Slapping belts in the shed,screeching shafts overhead, and the air is so stale y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u can't easily deeply inhale. 

	<p> Not far off the spring breeze rocks the fields, the sun calls...Leaning skyward the trees shade - &nbsp; the factory      <p>walls.</p> 

	<p> How unwanted, forgotten and strange are the fields!They have thrown in the dustbi
	<br>	the sky and its dreams.</p>  

	<p>For to stray for a second or soften your heart, is to lose to no purpose your strong worker's arm.</p> 

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You must shout in the clatter <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and din of machines <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for your words <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to pass over. <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the &nbsp; &nbsp;s&nbsp; &nbsp;p&nbsp; &nbsp;a&nbsp; &nbsp;c&nbsp; &nbsp;e&nbsp; &nbsp;s&nbsp; &nbsp; between.</p> 

	<p>I shouted for years - &nbsp; an eternity...
		I gathered the others too shouted in chorus - &nbsp; the <br>factory, <br>the machineryand the man in the farthest darkest corner.</p> 

	<p> This shout forged an alloy of steel <br>
		and we armoured our life with its plate. <br>
		Just try putting <br>
		a spoke on the wheel - &nbsp; <br>
		it's your own hand you'll break.</p> 

	<p> Y&nbsp; &nbsp;o&nbsp; &nbsp;u&nbsp; &nbsp;, 
	  <br> f <br>a <br>c <br>t <br>o <br>r <br>y, <br>
		still seek to blind us with smoke and soot layer on layer. In vain! For you teach us to struggle, we'll bring 
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the sun 
		<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> down to us here. 
	</p>
	<p>So many toil- &nbsp; blackened faces under your tyranny smart,but one heart within you tirelessly beats with a thousand hearts.</p>
