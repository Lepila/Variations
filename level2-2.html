    <h1> &nbsp;  &nbsp; The Factory</h1> 
<ol>
<li>
<h5>A factory. Clouds of smoke above.
	The people - simple,
	the life - hard, boring.
	Life with the mask and greasepaint off
	is a savage dog snarling.</h5>	
</li>
<li>
<h5>You must tirelessly fight,
	must be tough and persist,
	to extract from the teeth
	of the angry,
		bristling beast
	a crust.</h5>	
</li>
<li>
<h5>Slapping belts in the shed,
	screeching shafts overhead,
	and the air is so stale
	you can't easily
	deeply
	inhale.</h5>
	
	
</li>
<li><h5>Not far off the spring breeze
	rocks the fields, the sun calls...
	Leaning skyward
			the trees
	shade -
	the factory walls.</h5>
	
</li>
<li><h5>How unwanted,
	forgotten
and strange
 are the fields!</h5>
	
</li>
<li>	They 
	have thrown in the dustbin
	the sky and its dreams.

</li>
<li>
	For to stray for a second
	or soften your heart,
	is to lose to no purpose
	your strong
		worker's 
			arm.
</li>
<li>
	You must shout in the clatter
	and din of machines
	for your words
			to pass over.
	the spaces between.
</li>
<li>
	I shouted for years -
	an eternity...
	I gathered the others too shouted in chorus -
	the factory,
		 the machinery
	and the man
		in the farthest
				darkest corner.
</li>
<li>
	This shout forged an alloy of steel
	and we armoured our life with its plate.
	Just try putting
			a spoke on the wheel -
	it's your own hand you'll break.
</li>
<li>
	You, factory,
	still seek to blind us
	with smoke and soot
	layer on layer.
	In vain! For you teach us to struggle,
	we'll bring
	the sun
	down to us here.
	
</li>
<li>
	So many
	toil-blackened
			faces
under your tyranny smart,
but one heart within you tirelessly
beats with a thousand hearts.
</li>
</ol>
