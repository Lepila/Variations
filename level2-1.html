    <h1>The Factory</h1>
	<p>A <h4>factory</h4> . Clouds of smoke above. <br>
		The people -  simple, <br>
		the life - hard, boring. <br>
	<em>Life with the mask and greasepaint off</em><br>
		is a savage dog snarling. </p> 

	<p>You must tirelessly fight, <br>
		must be tough and persist, <br>
		to extract from the teeth <br>
		of the angry, <br>
		bristling beast <br>
		a crust.</p> 

	<p> <em>Slapping</em>  belts in the shed, <br>
	<em>screeching</em>	shafts overhead, <br>
		and the air is so stale <br>
		you can't easily <br>
		deeply <br>
		inhale.</p> 

	<p> Not far off the spring breeze <br>
		rocks the fields, the sun calls... <br>
		Leaning skyward <br>
		the trees <br>
		shade - &nbsp; <br>
		the <h4>factory</h4>  walls.</p> 

	<p> How unwanted, <br>
		forgotten <br>
		and strange <br>
		are the fields!</p> 

	<p>They <br>
		have thrown in the dustbin <br>
		the sky and its dreams.</p> 

	<p>For to stray for a second <br>
		or soften your heart, <br>
		is to lose to no purpose <br>
		your strong <br>
		worker's <br>
		arm.</p> 

	<p>You must shout in the clatter <br>
		and din of machines <br>
		for your words <br>
		to pass over. <br>
		the spaces between.</p> 

	<p>I shouted for years - &nbsp; <br>
		an eternity... <br>
		I gathered the others too shouted in chorus - &nbsp; <br>
		the <h4>factory</h4> , <br>
		the machinery <br>
		and the man <br>
		in the farthest <br>
		darkest corner.</p> 

	<p> This shout forged an alloy of steel <br>
		and we armoured our life with its plate. <br>
		Just try putting <br>
		a spoke on the wheel - &nbsp; <br>
		it's your own hand you'll break.</p> 

	<p> You, <h4>factory</h4> , <br>
		still seek to blind us <br>
		with smoke and soot <br>
		layer on layer. <br>
		In vain! For you teach us to struggle, <br>
	   <em>we'll bring</em><br>
		the sun <br>
		down to us here. 
	</p>
	<p>So many <br>
		toil- &nbsp; blackened <br>
		faces <br>
		under your tyranny smart, <br>
		but one heart within you tirelessly <br>
		beats with a thousand hearts.</p>
