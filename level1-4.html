	A factory. <br> Clouds of smoke <br> above. <br>
		The people - &nbsp; simple, <br>
		the <br> life - &nbsp; hard, <br> boring. <br>
		Life with the <br> mask and greasepaint off <br>
		is a <br> savage dog <br> snarling. <br>

	You must <br> tirelessly fight, <br>
		must be tough and <br> persist, <br>
		to extract <br> from <br> the teeth <br>
		of <br> the angry, <br>
		bristling beast <br>
		a crust. <br>

	Slapping <br> belts in the <br> shed, <br>
		screeching <br> shafts overhead, <br>
		and the <br> air is so stale <br>
		you can't easily <br>
		deeply <br>
		inhale. <br>

	 Not far <br> off the <br> spring breeze <br>
		rocks the fields, <br> the sun calls... <br>
		Leaning skyward <br>
		the <br> trees <br>
		shade - &nbsp; <br>
		the <br> factory walls. <br>

	 How <br> unwanted, <br>
		forgotten <br>
		and <br> strange <br>
		are <br> the fields! <br>

	<p>They have thrown  in the dustbin the sky and its dreams. For to stray for a second or soften your heart, is to lose to no purpose your strong worker's arm.  </p>

	You must <br> shout in the clatter <br>
		and din of machines <br>
		for <br> your words <br>
		to pass over. <br>
		the spaces between. <br>

	I <br> shouted for years - &nbsp; <br>
		an eternity... <br>
		I gathered <br> the others <br> too shouted in chorus - &nbsp; <br>
		the factory, <br>
		the machinery <br>
		and <br> the man <br>
		in the farthest <br>
		darkest <br> corner. <br>

	This shout <br> forged <br> an alloy of steel <br>
		and we <br> armoured our life with its plate. <br>
		Just try putting <br>
		a spoke <br> on the wheel - &nbsp; <br>
		it's your own <br> hand you'll <br> break. <br> 

	You, factory, <br>
		still seek to blind us <br>
		with <br> smoke <br> and soot <br>
		layer on layer. <br>
		In vain! For you teach <br> us to struggle, <br>
		we'll bring <br>
		the <br> sun <br>
		down to us here. <br>
	
	So many <br>
		toil- &nbsp; blackened <br>
		faces <br>
		under your <br> tyranny smart, <br>
		but one heart <br> within you <br> tirelessly <br>
		beats with a thousand <br> hearts.
