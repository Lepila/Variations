   <h1>The Factory</h1> 
  <p>A  <h4>factory</h4>. <h2>Clouds&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of smoke above</h2> . The people - simple, the life - hard, boring. <h4>Life with</h4>the mask and greasepaint&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off is a savage dog snarling. You must<h2>tirelessly</h2>  fight, must be tough and persist, to extract from the teeth of the angry, bristling beast a crust.<h4> Slapping</h4>belts in the  <h2>shed, screeching shafts</h2>overhead,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the air is so stale you can't easily deeply &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inhale. <h2> Not far</h2>off the spring breeze rocks the fields, the sun calls... <h4>Leaning skyward</h4> the trees shade - the factory walls. How unwanted, forgotten and strange are the fields! <h4>They have thrown</h4>  in the dustbin the sky and its dreams. For to stray for a second or<h2> soften your</h2> heart, is to lose to no purpose your strong <h2>worker's arm. </h2>You must&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shout <h4>in the</h4> clatter and din of machines <h4> for your words to pass</h4> over. the spaces between. I <h4>shouted</h4>for years -  an eternity... I&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gathered the <h4>others</h4> too shouted  <h2>in chorus</h2>- the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; factory, the machinery and the man in the farthest darkest corner. This shout forged an alloy<h2>of steel and we armoured</h2> our life with its plate. Just  <h4>try putting a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;spoke on</h4> the wheel -  it's your own <h4>hand</h4>you'll break. You, factory, still seek to blind us <h4> with smoke</h4> and soot layer on layer. In vain! For you teach us to struggle, we'll <h2>bring</h2> the sundown to us here. So many toil-  blackened faces under&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your tyranny smart, <h4>but one heart</h4> within you <h2>tirelessly&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beats with</h2> a thousand hearts.</p>
